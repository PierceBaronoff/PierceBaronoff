# Hey, I’m Vooskie 👋

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm the Co-Owner and CTO of [Many Hat Group](https://manyhatservices.com.au), and I also run [Zentari](https://zentari.com.au) — a Minecraft minigames network with a big focus on automation and polish.

---

### 🛠 What I do

I mostly build helpful scripts and tools to automate I.T. workloads — things like DNS management, server setups, and workflows that make ops life smoother. But I’m also into:

- Combat robots 🤖 (yes, real ones with weapons)
- DIY smart home devices and IoT builds
- Highly automated Minecraft infrastructure (because why not)

If it can be wired, coded, or built, I’m probably poking at it.

### 💻 Tech I Like Using

- `cmd`, PowerShell & Python (CLI is life)
- Web tech when needed
- Some Go and Linux magic when the mood strikes

---

### 📂 Featured Projects

Coming soon!  
_(I'll be dropping in some of my favorite public repos here as I open-source more of my tools and scripts.)_
